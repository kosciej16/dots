You see, this is one of my keybindings for downloading images

config.bind(';ww', 'set downloads.location.directory ~/pictures/wallpapers/general ;; hint images download ;; set downloads.location.prompt false ;; bind e hint images download')

basically, you press ;ww then download the image with the hint, it deactivates the downloads location prompt and binds e to download images from hints, this way, I can just open about 100 images, record the macro "e a d", this should download the image and close the tab, then I use the macro with the number of images I need to download, as an example: 100@a, this makes downloading dozens of images quite easy
